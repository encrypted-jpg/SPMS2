## Swimming Pool Management System

# Overview

The Swimming Pool Management System (SPMS) is a program to be used by multiple types of users: the team handling the administration of the pool, its members as well as those non-members wishing to use the pool for pre-defined purposes like signing up for membership, organizing a party.
	-	SPMS makes it easy for users to sign up and become a non-member user, or they can purchase membership too or even extend it. They can do various actions like participating in the competitions, booking events, booking a ticket for a competition etc. all from the website itself.
	-	System also provides an easy to use interface for the people responsible for running the pool, like course coordinators, committee members and manager. The use cases for each of these people have been defined in the SRS.
	-	SPMS aims to facilitate as many activities happening in a swimming pool as it can with the help of an easy to use website, using which there is an element of ease of use as websites can be accessed from anyone anywhere anytime provided he/she has an internet connection.
